                    The man who is known as the ‘Father of the Pentium Chip,' failed at the IIT-JEE exam. Dham’s success story is well-known as he started from scratch. He came to the US with just $8 in his pockets. While barely making ends meet, he completed his graduation and found a job for himself at Intel and, the rest, is history.

                    <strong>Early life</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Vinod Dham was born in 1950s in Pune, India.[9] His father was a member of the army civilian department who had moved from Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan to India during the Partition of India.[10] Dham graduated with BE degree in Electrical Engineering from Delhi College of Engineering in 1971 at the age of 21. At the age of 25, he left his family in Delhi, India to study for MS degree in Physics (Solid State) in the US, arriving with just $8 in his pocket.[11] He is married to Sadhana and has two sons. He has three brothers and a sister.
      
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Career</strong>
                    <br><br>

                    After completing a BE degree in Electrical Engineering in 1971, he joined Delhi-based semiconductor manufacturer Continental Devices,[12] one of India's only private silicon semiconductor start-ups at the time which collaborated with Teradyne Semiconductor Company, USA. He was a part of the early team that put together a facility in Delhi and worked there for four years. It was while he worked at this company that his love for semiconductors bloomed. He found it to be a very exciting field because it applied the knowledge he had learned as an Engineer and decided that he needed a deeper understanding of the Physics behind the behavior of the semiconductor devices.

                    In 1975, he left this job and went to University of Cincinnati,[1] in Ohio to pursue an MS degree in Physics (Solid-State). After getting MS degree in 1977, he joined NCR Corp[13] in Dayton, Ohio, as an engineer; there he did cutting-edge work in developing advanced non-volatile memories. Joining NCR was not a planned career move though. At the University of Cincinnati when NCR needed help Dham was the student in his class who had worked longest in semi-conductors. His leading-edge work on non-volatile memories helped NCR get a patent in 1985 on mixed dielectric process and non-volatile memory device.[14]
                    
                    He then joined Intel Co.[15] as an engineer, where he led the development of the world-famous Pentium processor. He is called the "Pentium Engineer"[16][17] for his role in the development of the Pentium Micro-Processor. He is also one of the co-inventors of Intel's first Flash Memory Technology (ETOX).[18] He rose to the position of Vice-President of Micro-Processor Group at Intel Co.
                    
                    During a presentation of his work on non-volatile memory for the NCR Microelectronics at an IEEE workshop, he was approached by Intel Co. and in 1979 joined Intel Co. as engineer, where he worked with the non-volatile memory team and was one of the co-inventor of Intel's first flash memory (ETOX). He later moved to the micro-processor division where he honed his skills for leading the Pentium project by working on two earlier generations of micro-processors-Intel's 386 and 486—in various capacities. In the 1980s, PCs had become mainstream tools for productivity enhancement at the workplace. By the time he started the Pentium project, many established and new players, including AIM consortium (led by Apple, IBM and Motorola) and ACE(Advanced Computing Environment) consortium formed in 1991 and led by Compaq, Microsoft, DEC, and MIPS Technologies, and a consortium by Sun MicroSystems (which comprised Sun, Fujitsu, Philips, Tatung and Amdahl) using superior RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) had all begun aggressively working on their big idea for PC industry and these projects seriously threatened Intel's dominance in segment. Dham believes that Intel's ability to 'focus and execute' while maintaining full compatibility of the application with its previous generation micro-processors was the key reason for its success over dozens of these big competitors. In a Business Week cover story on Intel's new processors, Dham was quoted as General Manager of the 586 processor group(586 was the internal name for the project until it was named 'Pentium' at launch).[19]
                    
                    He left Intel Co. in 1995 and joined the startup NexGen,[20] which was subsequently acquired by AMD.[21] Dham played an instrumental role in the launch of K6[22] – the "Pentium killer" processor at rival AMD Co. He held the vice president position of AMD's Computation Products Group. He then went on to lead a nascent startup, Silicon Spice[23] in April 1998, which he re-directed to build a VOIP chip and sold it to Broadcom[24] in 2000.He then launched an incubator NewPath Ventures,where he co-founded companies with an objective of using India's emerging talent in chip design for R&D. He is currently Managing Director and founder of Indo-US Venture Partners,[25] an early stage India focused fund that he founded after NewPath. Dham has over the years been a Board member and Tech Advisor to dozens of Private and Public Companies world-over!
                    
                    In February 2015, Dham announced his return to entrepreneurship as the co-founder and CEO of Acadgild, an online educational platform he co-founded with India's storied entrepreneur duo-Krishnan Ganesh and Meena Ganesh of Tutorvista fame. Acadgild aims to teach just about anybody, including a Class 10 student;Software Programming that is relevant to today's rapidly evolving digital world. Unlike many existing online courses that rely on videos;Acadgild provides live mentoring and hands-on engagement for building real applications for its students. It will also include building two applications, thus preparing the students for job ready skills and a more effective way for their perspective employers to evaluate them.

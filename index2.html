                <blockquote cite="https://brucelee.com/bruce-lee">
                    It’s a big thing to achieve what Satya Nadella has achieved today. The man who heads the billion dollar company is not an IIT-ian! Satya, in fact, studied at Manipal Institute of Technology. Satya’s example shows that you don’t have to be an IITian to make an impact on the world.

These five personalities are a great example of how an IIT degree isn't mandatory to lead a successful life. Clearly failing an IIT exam isn't the end of the world</span>

Later, he was made the president of Microsoft's $19 billion Server and Tools Business and led a transformation of the company's business and technology culture from client services to cloud infrastructure and services. He has been credited for helping bring Microsoft's database, Windows Server and developer tools to its Azure cloud.[21] The revenue from Cloud Services grew to $20.3 billion in June 2013 from $16.6 billion when he took over in 2011.[24] He received $84.5 million in 2016 pay.[25]

He then sent an email to Microsoft employees admitting he was "Completely wrong."

Nadella's tenure at Microsoft has emphasized working with companies and technologies with which Microsoft also competes, including Apple Inc., Salesforce, IBM, and Dropbox. In contrast to previous Microsoft campaigns against the Linux operating system, Nadella proclaimed that "Microsoft ❤️ Linux", and Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016.

Under Nadella, Microsoft revised its mission statement to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more". He orchestrated a cultural shift at Microsoft by emphasizing empathy, collaboration, and 'growth mindset'. He has transformed Microsoft's corporate culture into one that emphasizes continual learning and growth.

In 2014, Nadella's first acquisition with Microsoft's was of Mojang, a Swedish game company best known for the computer game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion. He followed that by purchasing Xamarin for an undisclosed amount.[45] He oversaw the purchase of professional network LinkedIn[46] in 2016 for $26.2 billion. On October 26, 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for US$7.5 billion.

Since Nadella became CEO, Microsoft stock had tripled by September 2018, with a 27% annual growth rate
